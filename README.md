# Music-GUI-WPF
Reworking of my music player and playlist editor app in Windows Presenation Foundation.  Lot's of missing features but the initial UI layout is there.

This is music player streamlined towards editing playlists. 
The design allows the user to open multiple playlists at once with the ability to drag and drop selected tracks between the controls.
This is based on an early Winform app I made so alot of capabilities are gutted out at the moment but will soon be added.
Only supports .m3u files at the moment, but it can playback a number of audio file formats as well as reading and writing ID3 tags.
Stay tuned!
