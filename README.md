# Music-GUI-WPF

This is a music player streamlined towards editing playlists. 
The design allows the user to open multiple playlists with the ability to drag and drop selected tracks between the controls.
This is based on an earlier Winform app I made so alot of capabilities are gutted out at the moment but will soon be added.
Only supports .m3u files at the moment, but it can playback a number of audio file formats as well as reading and writing ID3 tags.
Stay tuned!

This is a Visual Studio project built in .NET 4.6.1.
