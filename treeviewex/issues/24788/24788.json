    "Description": "Hello,\n\nWhen removing an item from the ItemsSource collection of one of the ViewModel node, if this node was selected (ie. in the SelectedItems collection), it will not be removed from the SelectedItems collection. Some other property might need to be updated too, such as LastSelectedItem.\n\nI provide you a simple project to reproduce the issue. Update the reference to the TreeViewEx assembly and it should build successfully. Execute and press the Delete key after selecting any of the node.",
