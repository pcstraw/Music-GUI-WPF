      "Message": "I thought about that. WindowsExplorer does it that way. WPF tree not. This is because we are talking about hierarchical itemcontrols, where each of them has a margin. Showing a border over the whole width would mean to change the whole concept to either calculate the margin for each child by ourselves or painting the selection box over all itemcontrols. \r\n\r\nBoth of it is not done that easily.",
