    "Description": "Thanks for selection fixing! But there are still minor issues.\nNormally selection rectangle should not cross control/window area, so you can't select items that are not shown. But here I can start selecting items, move mouse up/down crossing control area, then release mouse button, items that are not visible will also be selected.\nAnd also the scrolling speed while selecting is quite slow.",

You can experiment with the ScrollDelta/ScrollDelay fields of the AutoScroller.cs in order to suggest more appropriate values.\r\n\r\nDelay is the time between scrollrequests, Delta the offset to scroll.",
