    "Description": "When my treeviewex has horizontal scrollbar and I click to any item, it always scroll to opposite side - so when it is scrolled to the left, it scrolls to right and so on.\nWhen I changed VirtualizingTreePanel.MakeVisible to just return new Rect() as it was in previous version, it fixes (but probably brokes another functionality).\nThanks, Jan",
