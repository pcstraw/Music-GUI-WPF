    "Description": "I'm trying to get a UI Control enabled when a treeview item is selected using MVVM. I've been unsuccessful. \n\nFor example:\n  I have a radio button control property IsEnabled=\"{Binding=IsSelected}\". The IsSelected is set when the treeview item is selected(in the xaml Style). When I go through Debug the property is actually set but the UI doesn't reflect the change. The radio button control is still disabled. Any suggestions?",

If you see this one is set, then it is probably no problem of the TreeViewEx. Check your Binding by looking in the output window and check the binding mode.\r\n\r\nRegards,\nTorsten",
