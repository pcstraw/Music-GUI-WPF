    "Description": "When an item which is expanded and has selected child nodes, but is unselected itself, is collapsed, it is automatically selected. I haven't found the cause yet because I don't know where the expander button is actually located and what it does.",

You can verify when expanding the node again and then Ctrl+selecting another node. then the now again expanded node is no longer displayed as selected. The commented debug log line in the setter of IsSelected has indicated that.\r\n\r\nThe recent fix for issue 23068 (changeset 68107) doesn't seem to be responsible for that.",
