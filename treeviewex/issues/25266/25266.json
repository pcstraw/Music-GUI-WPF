    "Description": "There's a problem when using multi select in Virtualization mode since the ItemContainerGenerator will in that case return a null value and the control crashes.\n\nI've also remarked that there's too much overhead in the current multiselect implementation. I tried using it for selecting geometry data of complex 3D models and it takes ages to select more than 10 000 items.\n\nThe DataGrid in .NET 4.0 has a really nice multiselect function and it works like a charm even with 100 000 objects. We should have a look into it!\n\nReally like your work,\n\n/Mikael",

      "Message": "Ok, seems there are two problems:\n1. the nullrefException: Can you please tell me, how to reproduce this? Ive tried the following:\na) Start Virtualization sample\nb) Select Virtualization CheckBox and load Items\nc) Select element1 and element 11\nd) Scroll down and select element 2000\nWorks fine so far.\r\n\r\n2. The performance: I m not sure if I can do sth about that. A Datagrid is much more simple, because it does not have a hierarchy. I will have a look.\r\n\r\nRegards",

      "Message": "This is a major bug. And, at the moment I dont have an idea how to fix it. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, that in WPF the children of a treenode are calculated by the UI (HierarchicalDatatemplate/HeaderedItemsControl). So if the node is not visible and the virtualization is on, the UI is not initialized and there is not way to find/select the children. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I will prevent selection with shift if virtualization is enabled. Then at least no exception is thrown anymore.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a better idea, please let me know.",
