    "Description": "Would it be possible to have IsEditing setter public?\n\nThe purpose is to be able to use binding to trigger an edit.\nBasically I have a Rename command that set an IsEditing property to true in my view model, so I would like to trigger edition of the item via binding update.\nOtherwise it's impossible to trigger an edit from a Command without having the view model to interact with the view (my view models here do not have access to the view)",
