    "Description": "Keyboard navigation while IsVirtualizing==true causes exceptions...\n\nTry opening the \"VirtualizationSample\", enable \"Virtualize Items\", click \"Load Items\", click on an item, and then use the keyboard to navigate up and down.  I think the exception happened for me when I navigated down to the last visible item, tried to go one further down, and then tried to go back up more.\n\nI currently don't have plans to use virtualization... so I didn't try to figure out what is going wrong in the code... sorry!",
