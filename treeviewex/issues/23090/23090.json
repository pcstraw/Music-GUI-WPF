    "Description": "Setting TreeViewExItem.IsSelected renders the item as if it was selected, but the selection logic behind it doesn't know about it and will for example select the item again when Ctrl+clicking on it, instead of deselecting it (which would be obvious to the user who can only see the screen).\n \nI have databound that property to the ViewModel class and want to select an item through the view model's property. This is how I found this issue.\n \nThe item's IsSelected property seems to be written to by the selection strategy, but remote changes are not observed.",
