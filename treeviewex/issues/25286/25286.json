    "Description": "Hello,\nI have the following scenario: two TreeViewEx controls hosted in tabs, I want to synchronize them so that an update to one of them causes updates in the other. \nThe problem is that when I switch the tabs, the tree control that is hosted in the hidden tab will be unloaded. In TreeViewEx, in OnUnLoaded event handler we have:\n\n Selection = null;\n\nThe control will try to call ParentTreeView.Selection.ClearObsoleteItems in OnItemsChanged handler of TreeViewExItem. This of course results in NullReference crash.\nThe same happens in OnPropertyChanged (calls ParentTreeView.Selection.SelectFromProperty)\n\nWould be great if this could be fixed in the official version of the control :-)\n\nBest Regards,\nOla",
