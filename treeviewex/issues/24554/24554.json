    "Description": "The template returned by the DataTemplateSelector is not actually used by the TreeViewEx, although the DataTemplateSelector.SelectTemplate is still called. If I set manually an ItemTemplate, it works. The problem seems to be related to the use of a DataTemplateSelector.\n\nI'm attaching a sample project with the 3 following cases:\n - a TreeViewEx with a DataTemplateSelector, __not working__\n - a TreeViewEx with a single \"green\" ItemTemplate, working\n - a TreeView (the default control from Microsoft) using a DataTemplateSelector, working\n\n![Image](http://i.imgur.com/xuJoRIL.png)",
