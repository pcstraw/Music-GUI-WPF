    "Description": "In my application I use avalon dock along with treeviewex, and treeviewex does not seem to work well with it. I made a quick example project (attached here, no avalondock or treeviewex libraries included). Start the project, you'll notice the treeviewex on the right and the pane switcher below it. Switch to a different pane (which is empty) and then switch back. That completely breaks selection - you can't select or deselect anything. Also, trying to expand the node throws exception.",
