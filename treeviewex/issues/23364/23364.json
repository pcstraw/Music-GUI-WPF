      "Message": "AwaisBajwa,\r\n\r\nas I'm thinking about how one could add drag&drop support, I really think it should be done inside the TreeViewEx control itself and not be controlled from the outside by modified item controls. Alone for the visual feedback that should be given to the user. And inside the treeview control you'd have access to the actual item controls and their position and events. Adding item controls (instead of (view)model objects) to the items collection has already led to problems elsewhere.",

      "Message": "LonelyPixel Thanks for replying,\r\nYou are right. i was using view model before but i could not perform drag drop with that because by using view model i was getting nodes as strings and i needed node position to perform drag drop. i dont need visual feedback. so then i tried adding nodes of type TreeViewExItem with TreeViewExItem multi selection stopped working when i drag mouse on nodes it stopped selecting any of the item. then i used TreeViewItem multi selection worked with it but another issue came there that was when i select parent node all of its child nodes got selected",
