    "Description": "Hello,\n\nThis is not actually a bug (it's more a design error in WPF), so it's up to you to fix it or not.\nThe LastSelectedItem property is a read-only dependency property. The problem is that read-only dependency property does not support bindings in OneWayToSource mode.\n\nSee the bug entry on connect: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/540833/onewaytosource-binding-from-a-readonly-dependency-property\n\nSo I would advice to make this property writable, but throw an Exception saying \"LastSelectedItem is a readonly property.\" on its setter. I think some standard controls of WPF already do this.\n\nThe point is that it might be very useful to bind the last selected item to the view model (OneWayToSource), for exemple to bind easily a property grid sideway to the selected item.",
