      "Message": "FTR, you can do this already, just like with the stock WPF TreeView control. Just add a dummy child element, and when IsExpanded changes to true for the first time, replace that dummy element with whatever you'd like to see there. You'll do this all in the ViewModel class which the TreeViewExItem binds to through its template.
