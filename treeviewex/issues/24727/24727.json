    "Description": "When you draw a selection rectangle, then context menus stop working. I think the reason is in this block (BorderSElectionLogic.cs):\n\ninternal override void OnMouseUp(MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n{\n...\n        if (border != null)\n       {\n                border.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;\n                border.Dispose();\n                e.Handled = true;\n        }\nsince border is never set back to null, the mouse up event will always be handled, thus context menus do not appear. I think a border = null should be inserted here, and also into \"HandleInput\"",
