You could do it by calling\ntreeView.SelectedItems.Add(item) \nof better by binding some observablecollection from the viewmodel.\n\nSetting the IsSelected propery will not work because the selection mechanism does not realize that. See IsSelected more as an internal property.",

    "Description": "Hello,\nI am trying to bind the TreeViewItemEx's IsSelected property with my model and I am facing an issue.\n\nI have a strange behaviour when I set the model's IsSelected property before the TreeView is created : The item is visually selected, but when you click on another item, it does not behave as a selected item.\n\nAfter digging a little, I found that the selected items list is empty when you first click on an item. I think it should be initialized at tree view creation.\n\nPlease find attached a sample code.",
