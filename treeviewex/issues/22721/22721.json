    "Description": "This is a really good Tree control in order to be used as a Multi-select tree.\n \nWe tried to use the TreeviewEx in a demo application. We are facing problems in getting the name of the element through UI automation. \n \nWhat we are doing is giving the ItemSource to the tree and we use a Hierarchical Data template to show the elements of the tree and we append a number after every tree item indicating the number of elements under it.\n \nBut through UI automation we are not able to get this number alongside the tree view item which can be visible by using the normal WPF TreeView\n \nPlease find attached a demo application depicting the same also please find attached screen shots of the UISpy screen grab showing the numbers in the WPF TreeView as compared to it not showing the TreeViewEx\n \nCan you please help us resolve this issue.",
