    "Description": "When the currently selected item is being deleted from the tree, it is still the selected item. This leads to ghost data remaining in the view when binding to the selected item(s).\n\nSee my attached testcase. These two files are modified from the BindingSample project. They keep more references to the created tree items and add a key handler that deletes the item \"element11\" and shows the number of selected items afterwards.\n\nExpected result after selecting the element \"element11\" and then pressing any key (e. g. Ctrl):\nLabel \"selected item\" changes from \"element11\" to empty and message box shows \"0\".\n\nActual result:\nLabel \"selected item\" remains at \"element11\" which is not in the tree anymore and message box shows \"1\".",
