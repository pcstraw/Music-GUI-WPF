    "Description": "Hello,\nI noticed a strange behavior of tree control  - when I select a node and collapse parent node and click on empty space just below the last node - the tree changes selection to the node that previously (before collapse) occupied that space. Looks like VirtualizingStackPanel keeps all TreeViewExItems  and they are reported by HitTest (I looked into GetTreeViewItemUnderMouse in InputSubscriberBase)\n\nSteps to repro on SimpleEditSample:\n\n1. Select __element15__\n2. Collapse element1\n3. Click just below element1 (on empty space)\n4. Expand element1  => __element11__ is selected \n\nWould be great if you could fix that as It is very confusing when user selection changes without their notice...\n\nThanks and best regards,\nAleksandra",
