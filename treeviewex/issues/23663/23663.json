    "Description": "If you use right-click to make selection rectangles, and move your mouse out of the area of the TreeViewEx in a certain way, you can make lots of little rectangles that stay on the component.\n\n1) Click-and-hold RMB inside\n2) Drag cursor outside\n3) Release RMB\n4) Move mouse back inside\n5) Click-and-hold RMB inside\nrepeat from step 2\n\nYou can make lots of rectangles like in the screenshot, and I can't find a way to remove them either. (Resizing or populating the TreeViewEx doesn't do anything to them)",
