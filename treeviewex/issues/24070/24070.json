    "Description": "Hi, \n\nI have a tree-view with a lot of data and branches and I want to restrict the selection of nodes to certain level lets say level 3 and when user select multiple nodes or one, user will drag the nodes and drop it on the text-box and full path of the nodes will appear in the text-box or list-box. \n\nLet me know can I achieve this with this Tree-view. \n\nThanks, \nAttiqe",

It has a CancelEventArg.\r\n\r\nGetting the path is nothing the TreeViewEx can be responsible for. But I think the logic can easyly implemented by yourself.\r\n\r\nThis path you can return by the overridable drag method of your NodeViewModel. Take a look at the DragNDrop sample for more details. This data is given to the WPF DragNDropSystem (wrapped in a DataObject).\r\n\r\nHope this helps.",
