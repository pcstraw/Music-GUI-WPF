    "Description": "When editing an item using the provided EditTextBox control, if the binding is not set with UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged, then it is never updated. \n\nMy current workaround is to add the following method override in EditTextBox.cs. It's a bit hackish but it works, so you can use it if you want.\n\n```\nprotected override void OnLostKeyboardFocus(KeyboardFocusChangedEventArgs e)\n{\n    BindingExpression be = GetBindingExpression(TextProperty);\n    if (be != null)\n        be.UpdateSource();\n}\n```\n\nAlso, beside this issue, I noted the following inconsistency:\n\n```\ncase Key.Escape:\n    StopEditing();\n    e.Handled = true;\n        break;\ncase Key.Return:\n    FocusHelper.Focus(this);\n    IsEditing = false;\n    e.Handled = true;\n        break;\n```\n\nWhen the key is Return, StopEditing() is not invoked, I believe it should be.",
