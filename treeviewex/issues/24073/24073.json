    "Description": "Adding a child node to a node that didn't have children before\n does not add a triangle left to the node, as it should.\n In the simple sample I added this event handler to the button at the top:\n```\nprivate void Button_Click(object sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            (DataContext as Node).Children[0].Children[0].Children.Add(new Node() { Name = \"asdasdas\" });\n        }\n```\nOn clicking the button, element11 receives a child, but doesn't receive a triangle left to it.\n\n The opposite case doesn't work properly, either. If I change the event handler to the following:\n```\n private void Button_Click(object sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            (DataContext as Node).Children[0].Children[2].Children.RemoveAt(0);\n        }\n```\nand click the button twice, element13 doesn't have any children left, but still has a triangle which is weird because there is nothing to expand.",
