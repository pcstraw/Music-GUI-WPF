    "Description": "Mouse drag select causing sloppy mouse click to deselect item:\n\nWhen the user \"clicks\" on an item, but is sloppy about the click (both mouse down and mouse up are on the item, but he moves the mouse between mouse down and up), this seems to happen:\n\n1. The item is selected by mouse down\n2. The item is deselected by mouse move & area select with zero area\n3. The mouse up event is triggered, and the item stays deselected.\n\nProposed fix options:\n1. The area selection does not change selection until after it has some area to select whatever is under it\n2. The area selection always also selects the item under the initial mousedown hit test",
