I think the following would be correct:<br />\n<pre><code>when LeftMouseDown event we need to check item under mouse. If it not selected then select it. If it already selected then do nothing and unselect it when LeftMouseUp event.</code></pre>\n\nThis behevior implemented in MSVS treview (Solution Explorer) and Listview in Windows Explorer.<br />\nThis will normally perform drag and drop with multiple selection. In current implementation when I select multiple items and try to drag them by left pressed mouse on one of them selection change.<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
