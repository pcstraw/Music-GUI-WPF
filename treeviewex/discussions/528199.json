So thanks for that.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever I do have a problem:\r<br />\nI basically copied your DragNDrop sample xaml for the drag template but I'm having trouble getting the content presenter to show consistently. The drag and drop works fine but visually I cant tell that I'm even trying to drag items because sometimes the content presenter will show up, other times it wont. Also, I've noticed that if I have my TreeViewExItem context menu visible prior to the drag event then it <em>will</em> show up every time. Very strange.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny ides? I can post some &quot;code&quot; (xaml) if that will help.<br />\n",
