    "Html": "Yes, it does work in a completely other way. And it is done that way to make virtualization work. How ironic, that it does not work now. ;o(\r<br />\n<br />\nThe idea is: Implementing virtualization vor a TreeControl is almost not possible. You would have to implement your own VirtualizingPanel. Take a look at the source code of the VirtualizingStackpanel, it is highly complex. Therefor I was using the given one, but had to transform the treestructure in a flat list, rembering the structure, so I can draw it like a tree. Microsoft has implemented virtualization in the tree, by referencing their own tree control in the VirtualizingStackpanel and implementing a special treatment for it. So there is no way for me.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs far as I've seen now, it does not work because the ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll property is not set on the treeviewex. But entering it in the style does not yield any effect? Not sure why. Maybe anyone has an idea?<br />\n",
