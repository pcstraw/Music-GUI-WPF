    "Html": "Hi, I needed to turn the focusing off (by uncommenting the FocusHelper calls), since I faced problems when working with a search box. \r<br />\nThis searchbox (TextBox) executes a search in the TreeViewEx when I hit a key. The matching TreeItems are then selected. With focusing ON the searchbox obviously loses its focus when something is selected.\r<br />\nWhat is the use case for the focus feature? I think that I didn't realize it so far :-)\r<br />\nIs there a better way to turn it off, than uncommenting?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards, Matthias<br />\n",
